4. System records check-in time with timestamp
5. Employee works throughout the day
6. Employee clicks "Check Out" button to end work day
7. System records check-out time and calculates total work hours
8. Employee can view their attendance history

### Admin Flow

1. Admin logs into admin dashboard
2. Admin navigates to attendance management section
3. Admin views all employees' attendance data
4. Admin can filter by date range, employee, or department
5. Admin generates attendance reports
6. Admin exports data for payroll or HR purposes

### 4.3 Responsiveness

Mobile-first design with touch-optimized check-in/check-out buttons for employees using mobile devices. Desktop layout provides comprehensive data views for admin users.

## 5. Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Requirements

* Attendance table with employee\_id, check\_in\_time, check\_out\_time, date, total\_hours

* Indexes on employee\_id and date for efficient querying

* Validation to prevent duplicate check-ins without check-out

### API Endpoints Needed

* POST /api/attendance/check-in

* POST /api/attendance/check-out

* GET /api/attendance/employee/{id}

* GET /api/attendance/admin/overview

* GET /api/attendance/reports

### Security Considerations

* Validate user permissions before allowing attendance modifications

* Prevent time manipulation through client-side validation

* Log all attendance changes for audit purposes

* Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Integration Points

* Connect with existing user authentication system

* Integrate with payroll system for work hours calculation

* Sync with HR management system for employee data
